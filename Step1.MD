## Step 1: No pins, no score!

In Bowling, the whole point of the game is for the bowling ball to hit the pins. If you don't hit any pins, you don't get any points. This is your first test!

Please be strict about following the red-green-refactor cycle and always do the smallest amount of work possible to pass the test. Once the test passes, you can refactor (but only refactor!! No extra functionality that's not in the specs).
